## üéì Technical Insights

### Git Submodules in Docker/CI Environments

**Problem**: Git submodules don't automatically get included when checking out code in CI/CD pipelines.

**Learnings**:
- GitHub Actions requires explicit `submodules: recursive` in checkout steps
- Source tarballs from GitHub releases don't include submodule contents
- Docker builds should validate critical dependencies early (fail fast pattern)

**Best Practice**:
```yaml
# Always use this for repos with submodules
- uses: actions/checkout@v4
  with:
    submodules: recursive
```

**Validation in Dockerfile**:
```dockerfile
# Fail fast with helpful error message
RUN if [ ! -f "critical/dependency/file" ]; then \
      echo "ERROR: Dependency not found! Check submodules."; \
      exit 1; \
    fi
```

**Reference**: Fixed in [#88](https://github.com/Yeraze/meshmonitor/pull/88) (v1.11.2)

### React Component Design

**Problem**: Code duplication across components, missing edge case handling.

**Learnings**:
1. **Code duplication is a code smell** - If you copy-paste component logic, extract it
2. **Edge cases should be handled from the start** - Don't assume data is always valid
3. **Small, focused components are more maintainable** - Single responsibility principle

**Best Practice**:
```tsx
// ‚úÖ Good: Reusable component with edge case handling
interface Props {
  value?: number;
  otherValue?: number;
}

const MyComponent: React.FC<Props> = ({ value, otherValue }) => {
  // Guard against undefined
  if (value === undefined || otherValue === undefined) {
    return null;
  }

  const result = value - otherValue;

  // Guard against invalid calculated values
  if (result < 0) {
    return null;
  }

  return <span>{result}</span>;
};

// ‚ùå Bad: Inline logic duplicated in multiple places
{msg.hopStart !== undefined && msg.hopLimit !== undefined && (
  <span>{msg.hopStart - msg.hopLimit}</span>
)}
```

**Reference**: Refactored in [#84](https://github.com/Yeraze/meshmonitor/pull/84) - HopCountDisplay component

### Map Icon Rendering with Leaflet

**Learnings**:
- **divIcon with inline SVG** provides maximum flexibility and performance
- **Dynamic icon generation** allows data-driven styling (color by hop count, size by selection state)
- **Zoom-level based features** enhance UX without cluttering at low zoom
- **Color gradients** communicate network topology effectively

**Best Practice**:
```tsx
// Dynamic icon generation based on data
const createIcon = (data: NodeData, zoom: number) => {
  const color = getColorFromData(data);
  const size = data.isSelected ? 60 : 48;
  const showLabel = zoom >= 13;

  return L.divIcon({
    html: `
      <div style="position: relative;">
        <svg><!-- SVG content --></svg>
        ${showLabel ? `<div class="label">${data.name}</div>` : ''}
      </div>
    `,
    className: 'custom-icon',
    iconSize: [size, size],
    iconAnchor: [size / 2, size]
  });
};
```

**Reference**: Implemented in [#85](https://github.com/Yeraze/meshmonitor/pull/85) (v1.12.0)

## ‚úÖ What Works Well

### 1. Iterative Development with Code Review

**Process**:
1. Implement basic feature
2. Create PR and get code review feedback
3. Refactor based on feedback
4. Result: cleaner, more robust code

**Example**: PR #84 hop count display
- Initial: Duplicated inline logic
- Feedback: Extract to component, handle edge cases
- Result: Reusable HopCountDisplay component with validation

### 2. TodoWrite Tool for Task Management

**Benefits**:
- Tracks multi-step tasks systematically
- Keeps development organized through complex workflows
- Makes progress visible
- Helps ensure nothing is forgotten

**Best Practice**:
```javascript
// Start complex tasks with a todo list
TodoWrite([
  { content: "Analyze problem", status: "in_progress", activeForm: "..." },
  { content: "Implement solution", status: "pending", activeForm: "..." },
  { content: "Test changes", status: "pending", activeForm: "..." },
  { content: "Update documentation", status: "pending", activeForm: "..." }
]);

// Update as you progress
// Mark completed IMMEDIATELY after finishing each task
```

### 3. Rapid Bug Response Workflow

**Process demonstrated in Issue #86**:
1. User reports issue
2. Quickly identify root cause
3. Fix comprehensively (all affected areas)
4. Update documentation
5. Release bug fix version
6. Close issue with detailed resolution

**Timeline**: Same session from report to release!

### 4. Comprehensive Documentation

**Always update**:
- ‚úÖ README with setup instructions
- ‚úÖ Helpful error messages in code
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive release notes
- ‚úÖ Issue comments with resolution details

## ‚ùå What Didn't Work Well

### 1. Test Environment Issues

**Problem**: Created component tests but had jsdom environment issues, ended up removing tests.

**What went wrong**:
- Didn't ensure test environment was properly configured
- Gave up on tests instead of fixing the setup
- Left codebase without test coverage for new component

**Solution for next time**:
```typescript
// Ensure proper test setup
// vitest.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    environment: 'jsdom',
    setupFiles: './src/test/setup.ts',
  }
});

// Component test file
// @vitest-environment jsdom
import { render } from '@testing-library/react';
import MyComponent from './MyComponent';

describe('MyComponent', () => {
  it('renders correctly', () => {
    const { container } = render(<MyComponent />);
    expect(container).toMatchSnapshot();
  });
});
```

**Action**: Fix test environment configuration before starting component development.

### 2. Initial Code Quality

**Problem**: First implementation had duplicated code that should have been a component from the start.

**What went wrong**:
- Didn't think about reusability upfront
- Copy-pasted logic to second location
- Had to refactor later based on code review

**Solution for next time**:
- **Before writing code**: Ask "Will this logic be used in multiple places?"
- **If yes**: Extract to reusable component/function immediately
- **Code review mindset**: Review your own code before committing

### 3. Version Number Management

**Problem**:
- PR #84 was v1.11.1
- PR #85 was v1.12.0 (feature release)
- Merging #84 after #85 caused version conflicts
- Confusion between 1.11.1, 1.12.0, 1.12.1

**What went wrong**:
- Multiple PRs in flight with different version increments
- Didn't coordinate version numbers upfront
- Merge conflicts in package.json

**Solution for next time**:
```markdown
## Version Strategy

1. **Plan versions before creating PRs**
   - Agree on next version number
   - Document in PR title

2. **Version increment rules**
   - Major (x.0.0): Breaking changes
   - Minor (1.x.0): New features
   - Patch (1.1.x): Bug fixes

3. **Multiple PRs**
   - Stack patches on same minor version
   - If feature PR exists, coordinate next minor version
   - Merge features first, then patches

4. **Release branches**
   - Consider release/v1.x.x branches for complex releases
```

### 4. Merge Conflict Resolution

**Problem**: Had to force push an amended commit to fix version number.

**What went wrong**:
- Feature branch got stale relative to main
- Manual merge conflict resolution
- Force push required (not ideal)

**Solution for next time**:
```bash
# Merge main into feature branch regularly
git checkout feature-branch
git merge main
# Resolve conflicts
git push

# OR use rebase for cleaner history (before creating PR)
git checkout feature-branch
git rebase main
# Resolve conflicts
git push --force-with-lease
```

## üöÄ Process Improvements

### 1. Test-Driven Development

**Current problem**: Tests are an afterthought, sometimes skipped.

**Improvement**:
```markdown
1. Write test first (red)
2. Implement minimum code to pass (green)
3. Refactor (refactor)
4. Commit

This ensures:
- Test coverage from the start
- Tests actually work
- Edge cases are considered
```

### 2. Code Review Checklist

**Before creating PR**:
- [ ] Self-review code for duplication
- [ ] Check for edge cases (null, undefined, negative values)
- [ ] Add tests for new functionality
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Type check passes (`npm run typecheck`)
- [ ] All tests pass (`npm run test:run`)
- [ ] Consider reusability - could this be a component/utility?

### 3. Branch Management

**Best practices**:
- Merge main into feature branches every day
- Delete merged branches immediately
- Keep feature branches short-lived (< 3 days)
- Rebase before final PR (for clean history)

### 4. Version Planning

**Before starting work**:
- Check existing open PRs
- Coordinate version numbers
- Document in issue/PR
- Update package.json early in branch

## üí° Best Practices Reinforced

### Early Validation (Fail Fast)

```dockerfile
# Validate dependencies at build time
RUN if [ ! -f "required-file" ]; then \
      echo "ERROR: Missing dependency"; \
      echo "How to fix: <clear instructions>"; \
      exit 1; \
    fi
```

### Clear Error Messages

```typescript
// ‚ùå Bad
throw new Error('Invalid');

// ‚úÖ Good
throw new Error(
  'Invalid hop count: hopStart (${hopStart}) - hopLimit (${hopLimit}) = ${result}. ' +
  'Expected positive value. This may indicate malformed mesh packet data.'
);
```

### Documentation as Code

- README changes are as important as code changes
- Keep docs in sync with implementation
- Add examples for complex features
- Document known issues and workarounds

### Comprehensive Bug Fixes

When fixing a bug:
1. ‚úÖ Fix the immediate issue
2. ‚úÖ Find all similar occurrences
3. ‚úÖ Update all affected areas
4. ‚úÖ Add validation to prevent recurrence
5. ‚úÖ Update documentation
6. ‚úÖ Add tests for the bug

**Example**: Issue #86 fixed in:
- docker-publish.yml
- release.yml
- ci.yml
- Dockerfile validation
- README documentation
