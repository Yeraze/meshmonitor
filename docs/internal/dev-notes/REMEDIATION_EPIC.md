# Remediation Epic — Phase 0 + Phase 1 (issue #3962)

**Status doc for the epic orchestration run started 2026-07-06.** Canonical plan: [REMEDIATION_PLAN.md](./REMEDIATION_PLAN.md) / issue [#3962](https://github.com/Yeraze/meshmonitor/issues/3962). This file is the durable state for the `/epic` harness — update it at every phase boundary so a restarted session can resume from the first unchecked phase.

## Scope and decisions (user interview, 2026-07-06)

- **Scope of this run:** Phase 0 (all five tasks) + Phase 1 (all six tasks). Phases 2–5 are future epic runs.
- **PR granularity:** each numbered task is its own PR, per the plan's ground rules.
- **Merge policy:** auto-merge each PR once CI is green and orchestrator review passes (via `/merge`); post a summary per phase.
- **Task 0.2 (trust-proxy):** proceed as planned — default `trust proxy` to `false` when `TRUST_PROXY` is unset, keep the startup warning, document prominently in release notes/README.
- **Plan doc:** merged to main first (this branch) so plan + epic state live on main.

## Phase checklist

Each unchecked phase = one worktree → architect spec → implementation → review → PR → CI → merge cycle.

- [ ] **P0-docs** — Merge `docs/remediation-plan` (REMEDIATION_PLAN.md + this file) to main.
- [ ] **0.1** — Process-level safety net: `unhandledRejection`/`uncaughtException` handlers in `server.ts`, logging with full context and routing through `gracefulShutdown()`. Exit: deliberate `Promise.reject()` in dev logs and shuts down gracefully.
- [ ] **0.2** — Trust-proxy default → `false` when `TRUST_PROXY` unset; keep startup warning; release-notes/README documentation for proxied deployments.
- [ ] **0.3** — Pin `meshcore.js` fork dependency to a commit SHA; lockfile regenerated; `npm ci` reproducible.
- [ ] **0.4** — Strip/gate the hot-path `console.log`s in `src/services/api.ts` (CSRF token status + token prefix on every mutation); kept diagnostics behind a debug flag.
- [ ] **0.5** — `@typescript-eslint/no-floating-promises` as `error` for non-test code; violations fixed or explicitly `void`/`.catch()`ed.
- [ ] **1.1** — `withSourceScope` fails closed: omitting `sourceId` throws; explicit `ALL_SOURCES` sentinel for the documented global-by-design consumers (channel decryption, estimated positions, automations); full call-site audit.
- [ ] **1.2** — Type-check the tests: `tsconfig.tests.json` (strict, `noImplicitAny` off initially), wired into CI non-blocking first; flip to blocking once clean.
- [ ] **1.3** — Integration-grade route-test harness: in-memory SQLite + real Express app with real `requirePermission`/session/auth wiring; 3–5 representative route test files converted (source-scoped permission coverage); no mass conversion.
- [ ] **1.4** — Lint ratchets: `no-explicit-any` → `error` with checked-in baseline; forbid raw `fetch(` in `src/components/**`/`src/pages/**` (baselined); `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` + `prefer-const` → `error`.
- [ ] **1.5** — Response-envelope convention: `ok(res, data)` / `fail(res, status, code, msg)` helper for the `{ success, error, code }` envelope; documented in CLAUDE.md; new/modified handlers must use it.
- [ ] **1.6** — Schema-drift tripwire: CI test diffing `createTables()` schema vs full migration replay (001→latest), normalized `sqlite_master`, fail on divergence.

## Ordering notes

- Phase 0 tasks are independent; executed serially in numeric order (one phase in flight at a time).
- 0.5 and 1.4 both touch `eslint.config.mjs` — keep sequential.
- Phase 1 tasks run after Phase 0, in numeric order; 1.6 is the prerequisite for future Phase 3.3.
