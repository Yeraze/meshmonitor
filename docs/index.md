## What is Meshtastic?

[Meshtastic](https://meshtastic.org/) is an open-source, off-grid, decentralized mesh network built on affordable, low-power devices. MeshMonitor provides a web-based interface to monitor and manage your Meshtastic network.

## Key Features

### Network Visualization
View your entire mesh network on an interactive map, with nodes colored by their signal strength and connectivity status. Track node positions, signal quality, and network topology in real-time.

### Message History
Access complete message history across all channels. Search, filter, and export messages for analysis or record-keeping.

### Node Management
Monitor individual node health, battery levels, environmental telemetry, and connection status. View detailed statistics for each node in your network.

### Channel Configuration
Manage multiple channels, view channel settings, and monitor message flow across different communication channels in your mesh.

## Deployment Options

MeshMonitor supports multiple deployment scenarios:

- **Docker Compose**: Quick local deployment for testing and development
- **Kubernetes**: Production-ready deployment with Helm charts
