      "content": "MeshMonitor v3.3.0 introduces **user-specific permissions for Virtual Channels**, along with several quality-of-life improvements.\n\n## Virtual Channel Permissions\n\nVirtual channels (from the Channel Database) now support per-user **View Map** and **Read** permissions, just like device channels.\n\n## Action Required\n\nAdministrators should review their user permissions for any virtual channels:\n\n1. Navigate to **Settings > Users** and select a user\n2. Scroll to the new **Virtual Channel Permissions** section\n3. For each virtual channel, verify the appropriate **View Map** and **Read** permissions are assigned\n4. Non-admin users will only see nodes and messages from virtual channels they have been granted access to\n\n## Other Improvements\n\n- **Emoji tapback reactions** - Replying to a message with just an emoji now renders as a tapback pill instead of a full message bubble\n- **Sticky/pinned nodes** in the Messages tab\n- **Map improvements** - Clicking a node with Show Traceroute enabled now zooms to the node if no traceroute data exists\n- **Link Quality chart** improvements for sparse data\n- **Channel fixes** - Correct encryption status display, preserved disabled channels, shorthand PSK support in Channel Database",

      "title": "Important: User Permissions Changes",
      "content": "MeshMonitor v3.1.0 introduced an updated **User Permissions** system to provide more granular control over channel access.\n\n## What's Changed\n\nChannel permissions now use a **tri-state system** with three separate controls:\n\n- **View Map** - Can see node positions on the map\n- **Read** - Can read messages from the channel\n- **Write** - Can send messages to the channel\n\nThis allows configurations like \"map-only\" access where users can see nodes but not read messages.\n\n## Action Required\n\nAdministrators should review their permission settings:\n\n1. Navigate to **Settings > Users** and review each user's permissions\n2. Pay special attention to the **Anonymous** user - this controls what unauthenticated visitors can see\n3. For each channel, verify the appropriate **View Map** and **Read** permissions are assigned\n\n## Common Issue: Blank Maps\n\nIf users report seeing blank maps, this is likely a permissions issue. The **View Map** permission must be enabled for a channel for users to see nodes on the map.\n\nSee our [FAQ: Why is my map blank?](https://meshmonitor.org/faq#the-map-is-blank-for-anonymous-not-logged-in-users) for troubleshooting steps.\n\nFor complete documentation on the new permission system, see [Understanding Channel Permissions](https://meshmonitor.org/faq#understanding-channel-permissions).",
