# Meshtastic Node Configuration
# IP address of your Meshtastic node
MESHTASTIC_NODE_IP=192.168.1.100

# TCP port for Meshtastic node connection (default: 4403)
MESHTASTIC_TCP_PORT=4403

# Base URL for serving the application (optional)
# Set this if you're serving MeshMonitor from a subfolder (e.g., /meshmonitor)
# Leave empty or comment out to serve from root (/)
# BASE_URL=/meshmonitor

# Authentication & Session Configuration
# Session secret for cookie encryption (REQUIRED for production)
# Generate a secure random string: openssl rand -base64 32
# SESSION_SECRET=your-secure-random-string-here

# Session cookie lifetime in milliseconds (default: 86400000 = 24 hours)
# SESSION_MAX_AGE=86400000

# Reset session expiry on each request (default: true)
# When true, active users stay logged in indefinitely. When false, sessions expire at original login time + SESSION_MAX_AGE
# SESSION_ROLLING=true

# Cookie security settings
# COOKIE_SECURE: Require HTTPS for cookies (default: true in production, false in development)
# Set to false if accessing over HTTP in production (not recommended)
# COOKIE_SECURE=false

# COOKIE_SAMESITE: SameSite cookie policy (strict, lax, or none)
# Default: lax (recommended for production with reverse proxies)
# Use 'lax' for most cases - it's secure and works with reverse proxies
# Use 'strict' only if you need extra security and don't use reverse proxies
# COOKIE_SAMESITE=lax

# Reverse Proxy Configuration
# TRUST_PROXY: Trust reverse proxy headers (X-Forwarded-Proto, X-Forwarded-For, etc.)
# Required when using HTTPS reverse proxy (nginx, Traefik, Caddy, etc.)
# Values: true, false, 1 (number of hops), IP address, or CIDR range
# Default: 1 in production, unset in development
# TRUST_PROXY=true

# CORS Configuration
# ALLOWED_ORIGINS: Comma-separated list of allowed origins for CORS
# REQUIRED: Must be set to match how you access MeshMonitor, even for localhost
#
# For localhost access (most common for Docker deployments):
#   ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:8080
#
# For access via server IP address:
#   ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://192.168.1.50:8080
#
# For multiple access methods (localhost AND server IP):
#   ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:8080,http://192.168.1.50:8080
#
# For production with HTTPS:
#   ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://meshmonitor.example.com
#
# Multiple HTTPS domains:
#   ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://meshmonitor.example.com,https://mesh.example.com
#
# Wildcard (NOT recommended for production, testing only):
#   ALLOWED_ORIGINS=*
#
# If blank in development mode, defaults to http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:5173,http://localhost:8080
# However, it's best practice to explicitly set this value to avoid CORS issues
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:8080

# Web Push Notification Configuration (VAPID keys)
# Generate keys by running: node generate-vapid-keys.js
# VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY=your-public-key-here
# VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY=your-private-key-here
# VAPID_SUBJECT=mailto:your-email@example.com

# Push Notification Expiration (TTL - Time To Live)
# How long (in seconds) push services should attempt to deliver notifications before giving up
# Default: 3600 (1 hour) - prevents notification flooding when device comes back online
# Common values: 300 (5min), 3600 (1hr), 7200 (2hr), 86400 (24hr)
# PUSH_NOTIFICATION_TTL=3600

# Authentication Configuration
# DISABLE_ANONYMOUS: When set to 'true', disables anonymous access entirely
# Users will be presented with a login page and must authenticate before accessing any features
# Default: false (anonymous access allowed)
# DISABLE_ANONYMOUS=true
