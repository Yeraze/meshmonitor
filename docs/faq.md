# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

This page covers common issues and questions from MeshMonitor users. For developer-specific questions, see the [Development Documentation](/development/).

## üö® Common Issues

### I see a blank white screen when accessing MeshMonitor

**Problem:** You can access MeshMonitor's URL, but the page is completely blank or you see CORS errors in the browser console.

**Cause:** This is a **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)** issue. MeshMonitor blocks requests from unauthorized origins for security.

**Solution:** Set the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable:

```yaml
environment:
  - MESHTASTIC_NODE_IP=192.168.1.100
  - ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://192.168.1.50:8080  # Replace with your server's IP
```

**Common scenarios:**

1. **Accessing from another device on your network:**
   ```yaml
   - ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://192.168.1.50:8080
   ```

2. **Using a custom domain:**
   ```yaml
   - ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://meshmonitor.example.com
   ```

3. **Multiple access methods (comma-separated):**
   ```yaml
   - ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://192.168.1.50:8080,http://meshmonitor.local:8080,https://meshmonitor.example.com
   ```

**Note:** `http://localhost` works by default and doesn't need to be added.

**How to diagnose:**
1. Open your browser's Developer Tools (F12)
2. Check the Console tab for errors like:
   - `Access to fetch at 'http://...' from origin 'http://...' has been blocked by CORS policy`
   - `No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present`

**After fixing:**
```bash
docker compose down
docker compose up -d
```

### I can't login / Session immediately logs out

**Problem:** You enter your username and password, the login appears to succeed, but you're immediately logged out or redirected back to the login page.

**Cause:** This is a **cookie security** issue. MeshMonitor can't set session cookies due to security settings.

**Solution:** The fix depends on your deployment:

#### Scenario A: Behind HTTPS Reverse Proxy (Recommended)

If you're using nginx, Caddy, or Traefik with HTTPS:

```yaml
environment:
  - NODE_ENV=production
  - TRUST_PROXY=true              # Required!
  - SESSION_SECRET=your-secret-here
  - ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://meshmonitor.example.com
```

**Why:** When a reverse proxy terminates HTTPS, MeshMonitor sees the connection as HTTP. Setting `TRUST_PROXY=true` tells MeshMonitor to trust the `X-Forwarded-Proto` header from your proxy.

#### Scenario B: Direct HTTP Access (Development/Testing Only)

If you're accessing MeshMonitor directly over HTTP (no reverse proxy):

```yaml
environment:
  - NODE_ENV=production
  - COOKIE_SECURE=false          # Only for HTTP!
  - SESSION_SECRET=your-secret-here
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:** This reduces security. Use HTTPS for production deployments.

#### Scenario C: Direct HTTPS Access

If MeshMonitor itself handles HTTPS (with TLS certificates):

```yaml
environment:
  - NODE_ENV=production
  - SESSION_SECRET=your-secret-here
```

**How to diagnose:**
1. Open browser Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to Application tab ‚Üí Cookies
3. Check if `meshmonitor.sid` cookie exists after login
4. If missing, it's a cookie security issue
5. Check Docker logs for warnings about SESSION_SECRET or COOKIE_SECURE

**After fixing:**
```bash
docker compose down
docker compose up -d
```

## üì° Node Management

### Can I monitor multiple Meshtastic nodes with one MeshMonitor instance?

**No.** Each MeshMonitor instance connects to exactly **one** Meshtastic node at a time.

**Why:** MeshMonitor maintains a persistent TCP connection to a single node and stores all mesh data from that node's perspective.

**Solution for multiple nodes:**

Run multiple MeshMonitor instances, one per node:

```yaml
services:
  meshmonitor-node1:
    image: ghcr.io/yeraze/meshmonitor:latest
    container_name: meshmonitor-node1
    ports:
      - "8080:3001"
    volumes:
      - meshmonitor-node1-data:/data
    environment:
      - MESHTASTIC_NODE_IP=192.168.1.100
      - ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://192.168.1.50:8080
    restart: unless-stopped

  meshmonitor-node2:
    image: ghcr.io/yeraze/meshmonitor:latest
    container_name: meshmonitor-node2
    ports:
      - "8081:3001"  # Different port!
    volumes:
      - meshmonitor-node2-data:/data
    environment:
      - MESHTASTIC_NODE_IP=192.168.1.101
      - ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://192.168.1.50:8081
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  meshmonitor-node1-data:
  meshmonitor-node2-data:
```

Access them at:
- Node 1: `http://192.168.1.50:8080`
- Node 2: `http://192.168.1.50:8081`

## üîê User Management

### How do I reset a user's password as an admin?

1. **Login as admin** (or any user with admin permissions)

2. **Navigate to User Management:**
   - Click your username in the top right corner
   - Select "Admin Panel" from the dropdown
   - Click "User Management"

3. **Find the user:**
   - Locate the user in the user list
   - Click the "Reset Password" button next to their name

4. **Set new password:**
   - Enter a temporary password
   - Click "Save"
   - Provide this temporary password to the user
   - Instruct them to change it immediately after login

**Note:** Admin users can reset passwords for any user except other admins (unless you're a super admin).

---

### I forgot the admin password - how do I reset it?

**Problem:** You've lost access to the admin account and can't login.

**Solution:** You need to wipe the database and start fresh.

#### For Docker Deployments:

```bash
# Stop MeshMonitor
docker compose down

# Remove the data volume (this deletes ALL data!)
docker volume rm meshmonitor-meshmonitor-data

# Or if you named your volume differently:
docker volume ls  # Find your volume name
docker volume rm <your-volume-name>

# Start MeshMonitor
docker compose up -d
```

#### For Bare Metal Deployments:

```bash
# Stop MeshMonitor
# (use Ctrl+C or your process manager)

# Delete the database
rm -f data/meshmonitor.db

# Start MeshMonitor
npm start
```

**After wiping:**
- MeshMonitor will create a new database
- Default admin account will be recreated:
  - Username: `admin`
  - Password: `changeme`
- **‚ö†Ô∏è All data will be lost:** messages, nodes, user accounts, settings

**Alternative:** If you have SSH/shell access to the server and can read the SQLite database, you could manually reset the password hash, but this requires technical knowledge of bcrypt and SQL.

## üîÑ Updates & Maintenance

### How do I update MeshMonitor to the latest version?

#### For Docker Deployments:

```bash
# Pull the latest image
docker compose pull

# Restart with new image
docker compose down
docker compose up -d

# Verify version
docker compose logs meshmonitor | grep "Version:"
```

#### For Bare Metal Deployments:

```bash
# Stop MeshMonitor
# (use Ctrl+C or your process manager)

# Pull latest code
git pull origin main

# Update dependencies

  alpine tar czf /backup/meshmonitor-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz -C /data .

# Restore from backup (if needed)
docker run --rm \
  -v meshmonitor-meshmonitor-data:/data \
  -v ~/meshmonitor-backups:/backup \
  alpine tar xzf /backup/meshmonitor-backup-YYYYMMDD.tar.gz -C /data
```

#### For Bare Metal Deployments:

```bash
# The database is in the data directory
cp data/meshmonitor.db ~/meshmonitor-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).db
```

**What's backed up:**
- SQLite database (messages, nodes, users, settings)
- Session data
- All configuration stored in the database

**What's NOT backed up:**
- Environment variables (docker-compose.yml)
- Application code
- Docker images

## üåê Network & Connectivity

### MeshMonitor can't connect to my Meshtastic node

**Checklist:**

1. **Verify IP address:**
   ```bash
   ping 192.168.1.100  # Use your node's IP
   ```

2. **Check TCP port 4403 is accessible:**
   ```bash
   telnet 192.168.1.100 4403
   # Or use: nc -zv 192.168.1.100 4403
   ```

3. **Ensure node has network connectivity enabled:**
   - Open Meshtastic app
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Radio Configuration ‚Üí Network
   - Verify WiFi or Ethernet is enabled
   - Check that TCP is enabled

4. **Check firewall rules:**
   - Allow incoming TCP connections on port 4403
   - Check both node firewall and network firewall

5. **Verify in MeshMonitor:**
   - Check header for connection status
   - Click node name to see connection details
   - Check browser console (F12) for errors

**Still not working?**
- Try connecting with the official Meshtastic Python CLI to verify the node is accessible:
  ```bash
  pip install meshtastic
  meshtastic --host 192.168.1.100
  ```

### Can I use MeshMonitor with a Bluetooth or Serial Meshtastic device?

**Yes!** Use [meshtasticd](https://github.com/meshtastic/python/tree/master/meshtasticd) as a TCP proxy:

```bash
# Install meshtasticd
pip install meshtasticd

# For Bluetooth devices:
meshtasticd --ble-device "Meshtastic_1234"

# For Serial devices:
meshtasticd --serial-port /dev/ttyUSB0
```

Then configure MeshMonitor to connect to meshtasticd:

```yaml
environment:
  - MESHTASTIC_NODE_IP=localhost  # meshtasticd runs on localhost
  - MESHTASTIC_TCP_PORT=4403      # Default meshtasticd port
```

See the [meshtasticd configuration guide](/configuration/meshtasticd) for detailed setup instructions.

### How do I view MeshMonitor logs?

#### For Docker Deployments:

```bash
# View recent logs
docker compose logs meshmonitor

# Follow logs in real-time
docker compose logs -f meshmonitor

# View last 100 lines
docker compose logs --tail=100 meshmonitor
```

#### For Bare Metal Deployments:

Logs are printed to stdout/stderr where you ran `npm start` or `npm run dev:full`.

**What to look for:**
- Connection status to Meshtastic node
- Authentication events
- Error messages
- Version information

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Can I run MeshMonitor on a different port?

**Yes!** Change the port mapping in docker-compose.yml:

```yaml
ports:
  - "9000:3001"  # Access on port 9000 instead of 8080
```

Don't forget to update `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` if needed:
```yaml
environment:
  - ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://192.168.1.50:9000
```

---

### Can I run MeshMonitor in a subfolder (e.g., /meshmonitor)?

**Yes!** Set the `BASE_URL` environment variable:

```yaml
environment:
  - BASE_URL=/meshmonitor
  - MESHTASTIC_NODE_IP=192.168.1.100
```

Then configure your reverse proxy to route `/meshmonitor` to MeshMonitor. See the [Reverse Proxy guide](/configuration/reverse-proxy) for details.
