# Settings

The Settings tab allows you to customize MeshMonitor's behavior and manage your system. Settings are stored on the server and apply to all users accessing the application.

## Node Display

### Maximum Age of Active Nodes

**Description**: Controls which nodes appear in the Node List based on their last activity.

**Range**: 1-168 hours

**Default**: 24 hours

**Effect**: Nodes that haven't been heard from in longer than this period will not appear in the Node List. This helps keep the list focused on currently active nodes in your mesh network.

**Side Effects**: Setting this too low may cause frequently-active nodes to disappear from the list temporarily. Setting it too high may clutter the list with offline nodes.

### Unknown Nodes Filter

**Description**: Allows you to filter nodes that have no identifying name information. Unknown nodes are those without both a long name and short name, typically displayed as "Node 12345678" in the interface.

**Location**: Node List filter panel (identified by ❓ icon)

**Filter Modes**:
- **Show only**: Display only unknown nodes (useful for identifying devices that need configuration)
- **Hide matching**: Hide unknown nodes from the list (default behavior, keeps the list clean)

**How it works**: A node is considered "unknown" when it has no long name AND no short name (or both are empty/whitespace). This commonly happens with:
- Newly added devices that haven't been configured yet
- Devices reset to factory defaults
- Nodes that haven't broadcast their user information

**Use Cases**:
- Identifying unconfigured nodes in your network
- Cleaning up the node list to show only properly configured devices
- Finding devices that may need attention or setup

**Effect**: When combined with other filters, this helps manage large mesh networks by focusing on nodes with meaningful identification or highlighting those that need configuration.

### Device Role Filter *(New in v2.12)*

**Description**: Filter nodes based on their assigned Meshtastic device role, allowing you to focus on specific types of nodes in your network.

**Location**: Node List filter panel and Telemetry Dashboard

**Filter Modes**:
- **Show only**: Display only nodes with selected roles
- **Hide matching**: Hide nodes with selected roles from the list

**Available Roles**:
- **CLIENT**: Standard end-user devices (most common)
- **CLIENT_MUTE**: Receives messages but doesn't route
- **ROUTER**: Dedicated routing nodes
- **ROUTER_CLIENT**: Routes traffic and used by user
- **REPEATER**: Dedicated message repeaters
- **TRACKER**: GPS tracker devices
- **SENSOR**: Environmental sensor nodes
- **TAK**: Team Awareness Kit integration
- **CLIENT_HIDDEN**: Hidden client nodes
- **LOST_AND_FOUND**: Lost and found trackers
- **TAK_TRACKER**: TAK-enabled trackers

**Use Cases**:
- View only routing infrastructure (ROUTER, REPEATER roles)
- Focus on end-user devices (CLIENT roles)
- Monitor specialized nodes (SENSOR, TRACKER roles)
- Analyze network topology by node function
- Create focused views for network management

**Effect**: Helps organize and analyze large networks by grouping nodes by their functional role in the mesh.

### Security Filter *(New in v2.13)*

**Description**: Filter nodes based on detected security issues, allowing you to focus on nodes with security problems or hide them from view.

**Location**: Filter Modal popup (click "Filter" button in Nodes or Messages tab sidebar)

**Filter Options**:
- **All Nodes**: Show all nodes regardless of security status (default)
- **⚠️ Flagged Only**: Display only nodes with detected security issues
- **Hide Flagged**: Hide all flagged nodes from the list

**Security Issues Detected**:
- **Low-Entropy Keys**: Nodes using known weak public encryption keys
- **Duplicate Keys**: Multiple nodes sharing the same public key

**Use Cases**:
- Security audits: View all nodes with potential security vulnerabilities
- Clean view: Hide problematic nodes to focus on trusted devices
- Network monitoring: Quickly identify new security issues as they're detected
- Compliance: Ensure all nodes meet security standards

**Visual Indicators**:
- Flagged nodes display a ⚠️ warning icon in the node list
- Messages from flagged nodes show a red warning bar with details
- Hovering over warning icons shows specific security issue details

**Effect**: When "⚠️ Flagged Only" is selected, the node count updates to show "X/Total" format (e.g., "8/156 nodes"). This filter works alongside other filters (text search, device role, unknown nodes) and applies to both Nodes and Messages tabs.

**Learn More**: See [Security Features](/features/security) for detailed information about security monitoring, detection methods, and best practices.

## Node Details Block

**Location**: Messages page, displayed when a node is selected in the conversation list

The Node Details block provides comprehensive information about the currently selected node, displaying real-time metrics and device information in an easy-to-read format.

### Layout

The Node Details block uses a responsive grid layout:
- **Desktop**: 2-column grid for efficient space usage
- **Mobile**: Single column for better readability on small screens

### Missing Data

When information is unavailable, the block displays "N/A" for that metric. This commonly occurs when:
- Node hasn't transmitted certain telemetry data yet
- Information isn't available from the device type
- Connection was lost before all data was received

## Display Preferences

### Preferred Node List Sorting

**Field Options**: Long Name, Short Name, ID, Last Heard, SNR, Battery, Hardware Model, Hops

**Direction Options**: Ascending (A-Z, 0-9, oldest-newest) or Descending (Z-A, 9-0, newest-oldest)

**Default**: Long Name (Ascending)

**Effect**: Sets the default sorting for the Node List on the main page. Users can still manually sort the list, but it will return to this default on page reload.

### Time Format

**Options**: 12-hour (e.g., 3:45 PM) or 24-hour (e.g., 15:45)

**Default**: 24-hour

**Effect**: Changes how times are displayed throughout the application in messages, telemetry, and other time-based information.
