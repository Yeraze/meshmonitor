# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

This page covers common issues and questions from MeshMonitor users. For developer-specific questions, see the [Development Documentation](/development/).

## üö® Common Issues

### I see a blank white screen when accessing MeshMonitor

**Problem:** You can access MeshMonitor's URL, but the page is completely blank or you see CORS errors in the browser console.

**Cause:** This is a **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)** issue. MeshMonitor blocks requests from unauthorized origins for security.

**Solution:** Set the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable:

```yaml
environment:
  - MESHTASTIC_NODE_IP=192.168.1.100
  - ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://192.168.1.50:8080  # Replace with your server's IP
```

**Common scenarios:**

1. **Accessing from another device on your network:**
   ```yaml
   - ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://192.168.1.50:8080
   ```

2. **Using a custom domain:**
   ```yaml
   - ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://meshmonitor.example.com
   ```

3. **Multiple access methods (comma-separated):**
   ```yaml
   - ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://192.168.1.50:8080,http://meshmonitor.local:8080,https://meshmonitor.example.com
   ```

**Note:** `http://localhost` works by default and doesn't need to be added.

**How to diagnose:**
1. Open your browser's Developer Tools (F12)
2. Check the Console tab for errors like:
   - `Access to fetch at 'http://...' from origin 'http://...' has been blocked by CORS policy`
   - `No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present`

**After fixing:**
```bash
docker compose down
docker compose up -d
```

### I can't login / Session immediately logs out

**Problem:** You enter your username and password, the login appears to succeed, but you're immediately logged out or redirected back to the login page.

**Cause:** This is a **cookie security** issue. MeshMonitor can't set session cookies due to security settings.

**Solution:** The fix depends on your deployment:

#### Scenario A: Behind HTTPS Reverse Proxy (Recommended)

If you're using nginx, Caddy, or Traefik with HTTPS:

```yaml
environment:
  - NODE_ENV=production
  - TRUST_PROXY=true              # Required!
  - SESSION_SECRET=your-secret-here
  - ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://meshmonitor.example.com
```

**Why:** When a reverse proxy terminates HTTPS, MeshMonitor sees the connection as HTTP. Setting `TRUST_PROXY=true` tells MeshMonitor to trust the `X-Forwarded-Proto` header from your proxy.

#### Scenario B: Direct HTTP Access (Development/Testing Only)

If you're accessing MeshMonitor directly over HTTP (no reverse proxy):

```yaml
environment:
  - NODE_ENV=production
  - COOKIE_SECURE=false          # Only for HTTP!
  - SESSION_SECRET=your-secret-here
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:** This reduces security. Use HTTPS for production deployments.

#### Scenario C: Direct HTTPS Access

If MeshMonitor itself handles HTTPS (with TLS certificates):

```yaml
environment:
  - NODE_ENV=production
  - SESSION_SECRET=your-secret-here
```

**How to diagnose:**
1. Open browser Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to Application tab ‚Üí Cookies
3. Check if `meshmonitor.sid` cookie exists after login
4. If missing, it's a cookie security issue
5. Check Docker logs for warnings about SESSION_SECRET or COOKIE_SECURE

**After fixing:**
```bash
docker compose down
docker compose up -d
```

## üì° Node Management

### Can I monitor multiple Meshtastic nodes with one MeshMonitor instance?

**No.** Each MeshMonitor instance connects to exactly **one** Meshtastic node at a time.

**Why:** MeshMonitor maintains a persistent TCP connection to a single node and stores all mesh data from that node's perspective.

**Solution for multiple nodes:**

Run multiple MeshMonitor instances, one per node:

```yaml
services:
  meshmonitor-node1:
    image: ghcr.io/yeraze/meshmonitor:latest
    container_name: meshmonitor-node1
    ports:
      - "8080:3001"
    volumes:
      - meshmonitor-node1-data:/data
    environment:
      - MESHTASTIC_NODE_IP=192.168.1.100
      - ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://192.168.1.50:8080
    restart: unless-stopped

  meshmonitor-node2:
    image: ghcr.io/yeraze/meshmonitor:latest
    container_name: meshmonitor-node2
    ports:
      - "8081:3001"  # Different port!
    volumes:
      - meshmonitor-node2-data:/data
    environment:
      - MESHTASTIC_NODE_IP=192.168.1.101
      - ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://192.168.1.50:8081
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  meshmonitor-node1-data:
  meshmonitor-node2-data:
```

Access them at:
- Node 1: `http://192.168.1.50:8080`
- Node 2: `http://192.168.1.50:8081`

## üîê User Management

### How do I reset a user's password as an admin?

1. **Login as admin** (or any user with admin permissions)

2. **Navigate to User Management:**
   - Click your username in the top right corner
   - Select "Admin Panel" from the dropdown
   - Click "User Management"

3. **Find the user:**
   - Locate the user in the user list
   - Click the "Reset Password" button next to their name

4. **Set new password:**
   - Enter a temporary password
   - Click "Save"
   - Provide this temporary password to the user
   - Instruct them to change it immediately after login

**Note:** Admin users can reset passwords for any user except other admins (unless you're a super admin).

---

### I forgot the admin password - how do I reset it?

**Problem:** You've lost access to the admin account and can't login.

**Solution:** You need to wipe the database and start fresh.

#### For Docker Deployments:

```bash
# Stop MeshMonitor
docker compose down

# Remove the data volume (this deletes ALL data!)
docker volume rm meshmonitor-meshmonitor-data

# Or if you named your volume differently:
docker volume ls  # Find your volume name
docker volume rm <your-volume-name>

# Start MeshMonitor
docker compose up -d
```

#### For Bare Metal Deployments:

```bash
# Stop MeshMonitor
# (use Ctrl+C or your process manager)

# Delete the database
rm -f data/meshmonitor.db

# Start MeshMonitor
npm start
```

**After wiping:**
- MeshMonitor will create a new database
- Default admin account will be recreated:
  - Username: `admin`
  - Password: `changeme`
- **‚ö†Ô∏è All data will be lost:** messages, nodes, user accounts, settings

**Alternative:** If you have SSH/shell access to the server and can read the SQLite database, you could manually reset the password hash, but this requires technical knowledge of bcrypt and SQL.

## üîÑ Updates & Maintenance

### How do I update MeshMonitor to the latest version?

#### For Docker Deployments:

```bash
# Pull the latest image
docker compose pull

# Restart with new image
docker compose down
docker compose up -d

# Verify version
docker compose logs meshmonitor | grep "Version:"
```

#### For Bare Metal Deployments:

```bash
# Stop MeshMonitor
# (use Ctrl+C or your process manager)

# Pull latest code
git pull origin main

# Update dependencies
npm install

# Rebuild
npm run build
npm run build:server

# Start MeshMonitor
npm start
```

**Check for updates:** MeshMonitor displays a banner when a new version is available (requires internet connection).

---

### How do I back up my MeshMonitor data?

#### For Docker Deployments:

```bash
# Create backup directory
mkdir -p ~/meshmonitor-backups

# Backup the volume
docker run --rm \
  -v meshmonitor-meshmonitor-data:/data \
  -v ~/meshmonitor-backups:/backup \
  alpine tar czf /backup/meshmonitor-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz -C /data .

# Restore from backup (if needed)
docker run --rm \
  -v meshmonitor-meshmonitor-data:/data \
  -v ~/meshmonitor-backups:/backup \
  alpine tar xzf /backup/meshmonitor-backup-YYYYMMDD.tar.gz -C /data
```

#### For Bare Metal Deployments:

```bash
# The database is in the data directory
cp data/meshmonitor.db ~/meshmonitor-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).db
```

**What's backed up:**
- SQLite database (messages, nodes, users, settings)
- Session data
- All configuration stored in the database

**What's NOT backed up:**
- Environment variables (docker-compose.yml)
- Application code
- Docker images

## üåê Network & Connectivity

### MeshMonitor can't connect to my Meshtastic node

**Checklist:**

1. **Verify IP address:**
   ```bash
   ping 192.168.1.100  # Use your node's IP
   ```

2. **Check TCP port 4403 is accessible:**
   ```bash
   telnet 192.168.1.100 4403
   # Or use: nc -zv 192.168.1.100 4403
   ```

3. **Ensure node has network connectivity enabled:**
   - Open Meshtastic app
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Radio Configuration ‚Üí Network
   - Verify WiFi or Ethernet is enabled
   - Check that TCP is enabled

4. **Check firewall rules:**
   - Allow incoming TCP connections on port 4403
   - Check both node firewall and network firewall

5. **Verify in MeshMonitor:**
   - Check header for connection status
   - Click node name to see connection details
   - Check browser console (F12) for errors

**Still not working?**
- Try connecting with the official Meshtastic Python CLI to verify the node is accessible:
  ```bash
  pip install meshtastic
  meshtastic --host 192.168.1.100
  ```

### Can I use MeshMonitor with a Bluetooth or Serial Meshtastic device?

**Yes!** The solution depends on your connection type:

#### For Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Devices

Use the [MeshMonitor BLE Bridge](https://github.com/Yeraze/meshtastic-ble-bridge) to create a TCP-to-BLE gateway:

```bash
# Create .env file with your device's BLE MAC address
echo "BLE_ADDRESS=AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF" > .env

# Start MeshMonitor with BLE bridge
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.ble.yml up -d
```

The BLE bridge connects to your Bluetooth Meshtastic device and exposes it on TCP port 4403 for MeshMonitor.

See the [BLE Bridge repository](https://github.com/Yeraze/meshtastic-ble-bridge) for detailed setup instructions.

#### For Serial/USB Devices

Use [meshtasticd](https://github.com/meshtastic/python/tree/master/meshtasticd) as a TCP proxy:

```bash
# Install meshtasticd
pip install meshtasticd

# For Serial devices:
meshtasticd --serial-port /dev/ttyUSB0
```

Then configure MeshMonitor to connect to meshtasticd:

```yaml
environment:
  - MESHTASTIC_NODE_IP=localhost  # meshtasticd runs on localhost
  - MESHTASTIC_TCP_PORT=4403      # Default meshtasticd port
```

**Tip:** Hover over any icon to see a tooltip with more details!

---

### The map doesn't show any nodes

**Possible causes:**

1. **Nodes don't have GPS coordinates:**
   - Check if nodes have reported position data
   - Go to Nodes tab to see which nodes have coordinates
   - Nodes without GPS won't appear on the map

2. **Browser location permissions:**
   - Some map features require location permission
   - Check browser settings to allow location access

3. **Map tiles not loading:**
   - Check browser console (F12) for errors
   - Verify internet connection (map tiles load from OpenStreetMap)

---

### How do I send messages to a specific channel?

1. **Go to Messages tab**

2. **Select channel from dropdown:**
   - Click the channel selector at the top
   - Choose your target channel (e.g., "LongFast", "Private")

3. **Type and send:**
   - Type your message
   - Click Send or press Enter

**Note:** You can only send to channels configured on your connected node.

## üîî Notifications

### Push notifications don't work in Brave browser

**Problem:** When trying to subscribe to Web Push notifications in Brave browser, you get an error like `Registration failed - push service error`.

**Cause:** Brave browser requires Google push services to be enabled for Web Push notifications to work.

**Solution:**

1. **Enable Google Services for Push Messaging:**
   - Open Brave Settings: `brave://settings/privacy`
   - Scroll down to the **"Web3"** or **"Privacy and Security"** section
   - Find **"Use Google services for push messaging"**
   - Toggle it **ON**

2. **Restart Brave browser** completely (close all windows)

3. **Try subscribing again:**
   - Go to Configuration ‚Üí Notifications
   - Click "Enable Notifications"
   - Click "Subscribe to Notifications"

**Alternative:** If you don't want to enable Google services in Brave, you can:
- Use **Apprise notifications** instead (supports Discord, Slack, Telegram, Email, etc.)
- Use a different browser (Chrome, Edge, or Firefox have more reliable push support)
- Install MeshMonitor as a PWA on mobile devices

**Note:** Apprise notifications don't require browser push services and work independently of your browser choice.

---

### I'm not receiving notifications on my iPhone

**Problem:** You've enabled Web Push notifications but aren't receiving them on your iPhone (Safari or Chrome).

**Cause:** iOS is extremely strict about push notification validation. If the VAPID contact email is not set to a legitimate email address, iOS will reject push notifications as potential spam.

**Solution:**

1. **Set a valid VAPID contact email:**
   - Go to **Configuration ‚Üí Notifications**
   - Scroll to the **Web Push Configuration** section
   - Find the **VAPID Contact Email** field
   - Enter a **legitimate email address** (e.g., `admin@yourdomain.com` or your real email)
   - Click **Save**

2. **Re-subscribe to notifications:**
   - Scroll to the **Notification Subscription** section
   - Click **Unsubscribe** (if already subscribed)
   - Click **Subscribe to Notifications** again
   - Grant permission when prompted

**Why this matters:**
- VAPID (Voluntary Application Server Identification) requires a contact email for accountability
- iOS validates this email and rejects notifications if it appears invalid
- Android is more lenient and may work even with invalid emails like `mailto:admin@meshmonitor.local`
- For iOS, use a real email address like `admin@yourdomain.com` or your personal email

**Valid email examples:**
- ‚úÖ `admin@yourdomain.com`
- ‚úÖ `your.name@gmail.com`
- ‚úÖ `notifications@example.org`
- ‚ùå `mailto:admin@meshmonitor.local` (rejected by iOS)
- ‚ùå `admin@localhost` (rejected by iOS)
- ‚ùå `test@test.com` (may be rejected by iOS)

**Additional iOS considerations:**
- Ensure MeshMonitor is installed as a PWA (Progressive Web App) on your iPhone for best notification support
- Make sure "Allow Notifications" is enabled in iOS Settings for Safari/Chrome
- Test notifications by sending a test message - the notification should arrive within seconds

**Alternative for iOS users:**
If Web Push continues to be unreliable, use **Apprise notifications** instead:
- Supports services like Discord, Slack, Telegram, Pushover, and Email
- More reliable on iOS than browser-based push notifications
- Doesn't depend on browser permission or VAPID validation

---

## üìä Performance & Troubleshooting

### MeshMonitor is running slowly

**Common causes:**

1. **Large message database:**
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Database
   - Use "Cleanup Old Messages" to remove old data
   - Consider setting up automatic cleanup

2. **Low server resources:**
   - Check available memory: `docker stats` (Docker) or `free -h` (Linux)
   - Consider upgrading server resources

3. **Browser performance:**
   - Close other tabs/applications
   - Try a different browser
   - Clear browser cache

### How do I view MeshMonitor logs?

#### For Docker Deployments:

```bash
# View recent logs
docker compose logs meshmonitor

# Follow logs in real-time
docker compose logs -f meshmonitor

# View last 100 lines
docker compose logs --tail=100 meshmonitor
```

#### For Bare Metal Deployments:

Logs are printed to stdout/stderr where you ran `npm start` or `npm run dev:full`.

**What to look for:**
- Connection status to Meshtastic node
- Authentication events
- Error messages
- Version information

---

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Can I run MeshMonitor on a different port?

**Yes!** Change the port mapping in docker-compose.yml:

```yaml
ports:
  - "9000:3001"  # Access on port 9000 instead of 8080
```

Don't forget to update `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` if needed:
```yaml
environment:
  - ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://192.168.1.50:9000
```

---

### Can I run MeshMonitor in a subfolder (e.g., /meshmonitor)?

**Yes!** Set the `BASE_URL` environment variable:

```yaml
environment:
  - BASE_URL=/meshmonitor
  - MESHTASTIC_NODE_IP=192.168.1.100
```

Then configure your reverse proxy to route `/meshmonitor` to MeshMonitor. See the [Reverse Proxy guide](/configuration/reverse-proxy) for details.
